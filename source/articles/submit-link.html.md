title: Submit links to Higher Order Heroku yourself
date: February 15, 2013
---

The purpose of Higher Order Heroku is to aggregate links from the community and distribute as much quality information about developing on Heroku as possible. There's no reason the flow of this information needs to be determined by a single person.

If you have, or come across, an interesting article, presentation or video relevant to the Heroku community please submit it one of the following ways:

### Online link submission

<a href="https://hoheroku.wufoo.com/forms/z1ud198f00dvgsx/" onclick="window.open(this.href,  null, 'height=320, width=680, toolbar=0, location=0, status=1, scrollbars=1, resizable=1'); return false">Use this form</a> to submit a link.


### Via email

Send an email to [submit (at) higherorderheroku.com](mailto:submit@higherorderheroku.com) with the link URL.

### On Twitter

Ping or mention [@HOHeroku](https://twitter.com/HOHeroku) with the link.

I'll collect any submitted links and will schedule them for inclusion here or in the [Heroku Weekly](http://mad.ly/signups/72042/join). Thank you!
